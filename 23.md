Relays List
-----------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf` `author:cameri` `author:monlovesmango` `author:giszmo`

A special event with kind `10001`, meaning "relay list" is defined as a stringified content field containing an object where each member represents a relay the author uses.

This kind is similar to kind 2, but migrates towards kind 10001 to discourage relay bloat and encourage more consistent implementation. 

The tags array is empty.

The key, being the relay URL, **must** omit the trailing slash. 

The `read` value operates on the values of the [NIP-01](01.md) **filter** object, while the `write` rule operates on the values of the **event** object. 

When the `read` value equals `false` for a given **filter** the client SHOULD NOT send that filter in a `REQ` message to that relay.

When the `write` value equals `false` for a given **event** the client SHOULD NOT send that event in an `EVENT` message to that relay.

_Valid_
```
"content": {
  "wss://relayer.somewhere.xyz": {
    "read": "true",
    "write": "true"
  }
}
```

_Invalid_
```
"content": {
  "wss://relayer.somewhere.xyz/": {
    "read": "true",
    "write": "true"
  }
}
```

_Invalid_
```
"content": {
  "wss://relayer.somewhere.xyz": {
    "read": "true",
  }
}
```

### Purposes

This NIP serves two purposes: (1) backup and interoperability of relay lists and relay specific rules between clients; and (2) sharing of relay URLs between users.

The first use case is meant to make it so users can open their client -- or different clients -- in different devices and have their list of relays automatically fetched from a default relay and start using their relays list without having to set everything up again.

For the second purpose, if any client decides to, they can show to the user what relays other users are using, suggest that or automatically add these to the user's relay list. The possibility of sharing a list of relays in standardized format is good for spreading information about relays and contributes to the censorship-resistance of the network.

### Use cases
  - User selects relays from any number of sources and manages their relays' read and write capabilities.
  - User authenticates to client and client loads the user's relay list. User can modify their relay list from any client and have those changes reflect in other NIP-23 supported clients.  


### Extension possiblities 
This NIP can be extended at a later date to include more advanced rules while remaining backwards compatible.
