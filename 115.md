# NIP-XYZ: Yet Another Geo Tag (YAGT)

`draft` `optional`

This NIP adds a new indexable tag `G`. 

## Motivation
The core aim of this NIP is to establish a unified and efficient method for geocoded events. While attempting to implement `ISO-3166` with NIP-32, it became evident that more specific guidelines were needed for geocoding events. This NIP is designed to provide a clear and standardized format for geocoded events, promoting uniformity and effectiveness of geodata across nostr.

## Rationale
Developing a dedicated geotagging NIP offers several advantages over the general application of NIP-32 for geographical data:

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Using NIP-32 for geodata can lead to verbose and complex labels, making them challenging to understand. This NIP simplifies expression.
- **Handling ISO Standards:** The complexity added by ISO-3166-3 country code changes when using NIP-32 is streamlined in this NIP by simply labeling the channge as countryCode, thus making both publishing and filtering more straightforward.
- **Significance of Geodata:** Given its ubiquity, importance and diversity, geodata warrants its own specific letter designations and detailed specifications within nostr.
- **Backwards compatibility** In the event a country has a code change, events from both before and after the change are discoverable
- **Lean** Value types are implicit and do not bloat tag size. 

## Schema 
```
["G", value, marker]
```

## Value Types 
_`x` axis is ISO-3166 value type, and `y` axis is draft_
| draft      | alpha-2 | alpha-3 | alpha-4 | numeric |
|------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| ISO-3166-1 | ✓       | ✓       |         | ✓       |
| ISO-3166-2 | ✓       |         |         | ✓       |
| ISO-3166-3 | ✓       | ✓       |  ✓      | ✓       |


## Markers
Standards are assigned to human readable labels instead of labeling content with standards, which complicates both publishing and filtering.
_See above table for draft/value type compatiblity_
| marker      | alpha-2 | alpha-3 | alpha-4 | numeric |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| countryCode | ✓       | ✓       | ✓       | ✓       |
| regionCode  | ✓       |         |         | ✓       |

## Collisions 
Filter collisions have been mitigated as much as possible.
- `ISO-3166-1/2/3:numeric` codes have no collisions. 
- `ISO-3166-1/3` and `ISO-3166-2` [subdivisions] collisions are inconsequential.

# Best Practices
- `alpha-2` codes take prominence, other codes **MAY** optionally be included for system compatiblity.
- When publishing, if a country has an `ISO-3166-3` "change", `IO-3166-3:alpha-4` **SHOULD** be included (hint for parsing case)
- When publishing, if a country has an `ISO-3166-3` "change", the `ISO-3166-1` **SHOULD NOT** be included 
- When filtering, if a country has an `ISO-3166-3` "change", both the `ISO-3166-1` and `ISO-3166-3` code(s) **SHOULD** be included for most complete results.

## Examples

### Minimal Example 
```json
{ tags:
  [
    [ "G", "countryCode", "US" ]
  ]
}
```

### Robust Example
_Note: Antiquated ISO-3166-1 codes are included for example purposes_
```json
{ tags:
  [
    [ "G",  "AI",        "countryCode"     ],      //ISO-3166-1 alpha-2
    [ "G",  "AIA",       "countryCode"     ],      //ISO-3166-1 alpha-3
    [ "G",  "262",       "countryCode"     ],       //ISO-3166-1 numeric
    [ "G",  "DJ",        "countryCode"     ],      //ISO-3166-3 alpha-2 "change" 
    [ "G",  "DJI",       "countryCode"     ],      //ISO-3166-3 alpha-3 "change" 
    [ "G",  "AIDJ",      "countryCode"     ],      //ISO-3166-3 alpha-4 "change
    [ "G",  "AI",        "regionCode"      ],      //ISO-3166-2 regionCode alpha-2 (subdivision)
    [ "G",  "019",       "regionCode"      ],      //ISO-3166-2 regionCode numeric (subdivision)
    [ "G",  "419",       "subRegionCode"   ],      //ISO-3166-2 subRegionCode numeric (subdivision)
    [ "G",  "029",       "interRegionCode" ],      //ISO-3166-2 intermediate region code numeric (subdivision)
  ]
}
```

### Filter
_Effective for events where **countryCode** `G` is either `AI` or `DJ`_

```
{ "#G": ["AI", "AIDJ"] }
```
