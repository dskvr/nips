# NIP-XYZ: Yet Another Geo Tag (YAGT)

`draft` `optional`

This NIP adds a new indexable tag `G`. 

## Motivation
The core aim of this NIP is to establish a unified and efficient method for geocoded events. While attempting to implement `ISO-3166` with NIP-32, it became evident that more specific guidelines were needed for geocoding events. This NIP is designed to provide a clear and standardized format for geocoded events, promoting uniformity and effectiveness of geodata across nostr.

## Rationale
Developing a dedicated geotagging NIP offers several advantages over the general application of NIP-32 for geographical data:

- **Simplicity and Clarity:** Using NIP-32 for geodata can lead to verbose and complex labels, making them challenging to understand. This NIP simplifies expression.
- **Handling ISO Standards:** The complexity added by ISO-3166-3 country code changes when using NIP-32 is streamlined in this NIP by simply labeling the channge as countryCode, thus making both publishing and filtering more straightforward.
- **Significance of Geodata:** Given its ubiquity, importance and diversity, geodata warrants its own specific letter designations and detailed specifications within nostr.

## Schema 
```
["G", value, marker]
```

## Markers
Standards are assigned to human readable labels instead of labeling content with standards, which complicates both publishing and filtering. 

- `countryCode` - `ISO-3166-1/3` country code (`alpha-2`, `alpha-3`, `numeric`)
- `countryName` - `ISO-3166-1/3` compatible country name. (`alpha-4` "change")
- `regionCode` - `ISO-3166-2` region code (`alpha-2`)
- `regionName` - `ISO-3166-2` compatible region name.

## Collisions 
Filter collisions have been mitigated as much as possible.
- `ISO-3166` codes (`countryCode`, `regionCode`) are always uppercase
- `ISO-3166` names are always proper-case (`countryName`, `regionName`)
- `cityName` has the highest potential for collision since it is not standardized. There are two theoretical collision cases: 
  1. A `cityName` collides with a `countryName` or `regionName`. For example, `Singapore` [inconsequential] and `Victoria` [consequential] respectively.
  2. If a client or user adds a `cityName` that is not proper-cased (first letter capitalized), the `cityName` contains no spaces and the `cityName` is `base32`. 

## Examples

### Minimal Example 
```json
{ tags:
  [
    [ "G", "countryCode", "US" ]
  ]
}
```

### Robust Example
```json
{ tags:
  [
    [ "G",  "AI",        "countryCode" ],      //ISO-3166-1 alpha2
    [ "G",  "AIA",       "countryCode" ],      //ISO-3166-1 alpha-3
    [ "G",  "262",       "countryCode" ]       //ISO-3166-1 numeric
    [ "G",  "AIDJ",      "countryCode" ],      //ISO-3166-3 alpha-4 "change" 
    [ "G",  "Anguilla",  "countryName" ],      //ISO-3166-1 countryName
    [ "G",  "AI",        "regionCode" ],       //ISO-3166-2 alpha-2
    [ "G",  "019",       "regionCode"],        //ISO-3166-2 regionCode numeric (subdivision)
    [ "G",  "419",       "subRegionCode"],     //ISO-3166-2 subRegionCode numeric (subdivision)
    [ "G",  "029",       "interRegionCode"],   //ISO-3166-2 intermediate region code numeric (subdivision)
  ] 
}
```

### Filter
_Effective for events where **countryCode** `G` is either `AI` or `DJ`_

```
{ "#G": ["AI", "AIDJ"] }
```
